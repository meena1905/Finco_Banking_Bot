- AI-generated Responses using OpenAI LLM
- Ticketing System with unique IDs
- Employee Dashboard to view & resolve complaints
- Database storage with SQLite
- Responsive UI using Flask + Bootstrap
- Deployment-ready on Render

---

##  Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask

##  Notes

- OpenAI API: The AI reply system requires an OpenAI API key. Make sure to set it in `predict.py` before running the app.  
- SQLite Database: All complaints, ticket IDs, priorities, and employee replies are stored in `complaints.db`.  
- Bootstrap: The frontend uses Bootstrap for responsive and clean UI design.  
- ML Model: Complaint classification uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (trained model saved in `models/`).  
- Jupyter Users: You can run the Flask app directly in Jupyter using `!python app.py` in a notebook cell.  
- Deployment: The app is deployment-ready using Render + Gunicorn (`Procfile` included).
